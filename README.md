# Zamux
My Termux setup is customized to enhance the user experience by incorporating personalized design elements. The dracula colorscheme has been selected to improve visual appeal, while the font has been modified for improved readability. Additional components such as zsh and bat have been integrated to enhance convenience and provide aesthetic value.
