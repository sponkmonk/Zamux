# Zamux
My Termux setup is customized to enhance the user experience by incorporating personalized design elements. The dracula colorscheme has been selected to improve visual appeal, while the font has been modified for improved readability. Additional components such as zsh and bat have been integrated to enhance convenience and provide aesthetic value.

## Components and/or requirements

This setup was made on Android, but will work on iOS trough iSH if that's what you like!

**·[Termux](https://termux.dev/en/), always grab it from [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).**

## Credits

The realization of my customized setup is owed to the dedicated communities and developers who have contributed their time and expertise to the open-source movement. It is truly an honor to be a part of such a collaborative and supportive community where individuals assist one another in achieving their objectives. As such, I urge everyone to support and recognize the developers responsible for the dependencies I have utilized.

Furthermore, I feel it is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate the creators of the individual components utilized within my setup. It is thanks to their talent that I was able to construct the pieces of this "puzzle." While I have made minor modifications to some files, it is their original work that served as the foundation for my setup.
