# Zamux
My Termux rice, nothing special just my personal touch to make using it more appealing. It uses a dracula colorscheme, I just love it, and changes the font a bit. It incorporates other components like zsh or bat just to add some eye candy and convenience to the experience.

## Components and/or requirements
These config files will probably work on any distro, but gentoo is a personal recommendation for the tinkerers. It's a really simple and barebones setup.

**·[Termux](), always grab it from F-droid.**
## Credits

The realization of my customized setup is owed to the dedicated communities and developers who have contributed their time and expertise to the open-source movement. It is truly an honor to be a part of such a collaborative and supportive community where individuals assist one another in achieving their objectives. As such, I urge everyone to support and recognize the developers responsible for the dependencies I have utilized.

Furthermore, I feel it is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate the creators of the individual components utilized within my setup. It is thanks to their talent that I was able to construct the pieces of this "puzzle." While I have made minor modifications to some files, it is their original work that served as the foundation for my setup.
